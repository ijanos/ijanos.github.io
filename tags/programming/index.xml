      <description>This year&amp;rsquo;s Advent of Code starts in a few hours. I had a really good time participating in it last year. Having a programming puzzle to solve every day as count down to the holidays was surprisingly fun. I had a self imposed challenge of doing at least one commit every day which I then continued to pretty long commit streak right before GitHub removed the counter.
Last year I was using python to solve the puzzles, you can check out my solutions on GitHub.</description>
