      <description>My sister has an ASUS K43 laptop that started misbehaving. Failing to detect and charge when the power cord was plugged in, making a connection with the plug become fiddly. Warranty long gone, the response in repair shops was the classic &amp;ldquo;we have to change the motherboard&amp;rdquo;. Unsatisfied with that answer I found out that the power socket is a common fault in these ASUS machines and you can order replacement sockets for less than a US dollar on eBay.</description>
